### Langauge for Hackers (Very Unsafe Language)
Some Ideas include
- no types except bytes
- huge focus on debugability such as lang-embedded stack trace
- no such thing as references, only moves. (perf)
- manual mm
- language is very pure, almost everything will be implemented as a library
- extremely modular language (embracing the micro-architecture)
- ... more to come soon
